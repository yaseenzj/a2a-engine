# Enterprise Service Operations Platform

## Overview

The objective of this project is to build an **Service Operations Platform** that intelligently orchestrates multiple AI agents to automate and manage enterprise service requests across various business domains.

Unlike traditional workflow automation systems that rely on predefined business rules, this platform should dynamically understand user requests, discover appropriate agents, generate execution plans, coordinate workflows, retrieve enterprise knowledge, and produce intelligent responses.

The platform should be designed as a **general-purpose enterprise AI platform**, capable of supporting IT operations, HR services, Finance, Procurement, Legal, Customer Operations, Facilities, and other business functions without changing the core orchestration logic.

The project should demonstrate modern Agentic AI concepts including **LangGraph orchestration, Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), plug-and-play agent architecture, structured outputs, conversation memory, reflection, JWT authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and modular enterprise system design.**

# Objectives

Build an enterprise platform capable of:

- Understanding enterprise service requests
- Planning workflows dynamically
- Discovering agents based on capabilities
- Coordinating multiple AI agents
- Supporting plug-and-play agent registration
- Retrieving enterprise knowledge using RAG
- Maintaining user and workflow context
- Managing approvals and escalations
- Producing structured workflow outputs
- Supporting reflection-based execution
- Securing enterprise services using authentication and authorization

---

# Functional Requirements

## 1. Authentication & User Management

Secure the platform using JWT authentication.

Authenticated users should be able to:

- Submit service requests
- View request history
- Track workflow status
- Access authorized enterprise services

Each authenticated user should contain information such as:

- User ID
- Name
- Department
- Role
- Business Unit
- Access Permissions

---

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Implement Role-Based Access Control to secure enterprise operations.

Suggested roles include:

- Administrator
- Employee
- Manager
- HR
- Finance
- IT
- Procurement
- Legal
- Operations

Permissions should control access to:

- Enterprise services
- Internal knowledge
- Workflow execution
- Business approvals
- Administrative APIs

The orchestrator should validate permissions before executing any protected workflow.

---

## 3. Service Request Understanding

The platform should understand incoming enterprise requests using an LLM.

Extract information including:

- Intent
- Business Domain
- Required Capabilities
- Priority
- Urgency
- Dependencies

Represent extracted information using structured outputs.

---

## 4. Dynamic Workflow Planning

Instead of predefined workflows, the platform should dynamically generate execution plans.

The planner should determine:

- Required tasks
- Required capabilities
- Agent execution order
- Parallel execution opportunities
- Approval requirements

Planning should remain independent of individual agent implementations.

---

## 5. Dynamic Agent Discovery

Implement a centralized Agent Registry.

Each agent should register itself with metadata describing:

- Name
- Description
- Supported Capabilities
- Input Schema
- Output Schema
- Endpoint
- Version
- Health Status

The orchestrator should discover agents dynamically based on capabilities instead of hardcoded routing.

---

## 6. Plug-and-Play Agent Support

The platform should allow new agents to be added without modifying the orchestrator.

New agents should automatically become available after registration.

The orchestrator should dynamically include newly registered agents in future workflow planning.

---

## 7. Multi-Agent Collaboration

The platform should coordinate multiple specialized agents throughout workflow execution.

Possible business agents include(examples):

- Authentication Agent
- Identity Agent
- HR Agent
- Finance Agent
- Procurement Agent
- Legal Agent
- IT Operations Agent
- CRM Agent
- Incident Management Agent
- Knowledge Retrieval Agent
- Notification Agent
- Approval Agent
- Analytics Agent
- Reflection Agent

Each agent should focus on a single responsibility and communicate using structured interfaces.

---

## 8. Enterprise Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)

Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enterprise knowledge retrieval.

Knowledge sources may include:

- Policies
- Standard Operating Procedures
- Technical Documentation
- Knowledge Base Articles
- Internal Guidelines
- Compliance Documents
- Process Documentation

The retrieved information should be used to generate accurate and grounded responses.

---

## 9. Workflow Memory

Maintain workflow context throughout execution.

Memory may include:

- Previous requests
- User preferences
- Previous approvals
- Frequently used workflows
- Historical executions
- Agent execution history

Memory should improve future workflow planning and personalization.

---

## 10. Reflection & Workflow Validation

After workflow execution, validate whether the requested objective has been successfully completed.

Reflection should identify:

- Missing tasks
- Failed executions
- Missing approvals
- Low-confidence outputs
- Incomplete workflows

If necessary, the orchestrator should:

- Retry tasks
- Invoke additional agents
- Re-plan the workflow
- Request additional information

---

## 11. Human-in-the-Loop

Certain workflows may require human approval before continuing.

The platform should support:

- Workflow interruption
- Manual approval
- Workflow resumption
- Approval history
- Audit trail

Human approval should integrate naturally into the orchestration workflow.

---

## 12. Notifications

Generate notifications for important workflow events.

Possible notifications include:

- Workflow completion
- Approval requests
- Escalations
- Errors
- Status updates
- Assignment notifications

---

## 13. Workflow Monitoring

Track workflow execution details including:

- Running workflows
- Active agents
- Failed executions
- Retry count
- Processing time
- Agent utilization
- Workflow history

Operational insights should be available through APIs or dashboards.

---

# Agent Communication (A2A)

The platform should adopt an Agent-to-Agent (A2A) inspired architecture.

Each agent should expose a standardized Agent Card containing:

- Agent Name
- Description
- Supported Capabilities
- Input Schema
- Output Schema
- Endpoint
- Version

Agents should communicate through structured requests and responses instead of implementation-specific integrations.

The orchestrator should remain independent of individual agent implementations.

---

# LangGraph Workflow

Use LangGraph to orchestrate the complete workflow.

The workflow should support:

- Dynamic planning
- Conditional routing
- Parallel execution
- Stateful execution
- Reflection loops
- Human approval checkpoints

The workflow should remain modular and extensible.

# Notes

- Design every component to be modular and independently deployable.
- Keep orchestration logic separate from agent implementations.
- Use capability-based agent discovery instead of hardcoded routing.
- Use structured Pydantic models for all AI inputs and outputs.
- Ensure the platform can support new business domains by simply registering new agents.
- Keep prompts separate from application logic.
- Prioritize extensibility, maintainability, scalability, and clean architecture over implementing every possible workflow.
